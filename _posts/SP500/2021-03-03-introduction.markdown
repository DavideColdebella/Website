This post is the first of a series dedicated to extract covariance/correlation matrices from the daily returns. Here I will present the raw data and perform a basic exploration to assess the presence of missing values and outliers. In the next post we will see how to post process the data.

##### **Summary**
The data contains daily closure prices for 400 stocks over the years 2000/2016. Almost 12% of data is missing but, after deleting 90 stocks, it is reduced to 1% but it is not filled. We compute the simple returns and see that outliers are indeed present.

### S&P500 Data

This whole analysis is part of a project, called PiÂ², started from the [ESILV](https://www.esilv.fr/) school in Paris. The school put us in contact with [G. Marti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gautier-marti-344b565a/) who supplied the dataset.

This dataset is a .csv file containing daily closure prices for ~400 stocks tracked from early 2000 to late 2016. From the graph below we can see that 12% of data is missing. To be precise, 133 stocks have at least one missing entry, 90 have more than 30% missing entries and 62 have more than half missing entries. We discard those 90 stocks and end up with a dataset having only 1% missing data; moreover all stocks are time series of at least 10 years thus, when we will extrapolate the correlation/covariance matrices, for each single stock we will have a more heterogeneous history.

### Simple returns

After the above step we compute the simple returns by the formula
