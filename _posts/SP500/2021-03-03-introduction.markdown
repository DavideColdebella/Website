This post is the first of a series dedicated to extract covariance/correlation matrices from the daily returns. Here I will present the raw data and perform a basic exploration to assess the presence of missing values and outliers. In the next post we will see how to post process the data.

##### **Summary**
The data contains daily closure prices for 400 stocks over the years 2000/2016. Almost 12% of data is missing but, after deleting 90 stocks, it is reduced to 1% but it is not filled. We compute the simple returns and see that outliers are indeed present.

### S&P500 Data

This whole analysis is part of a project, called PiÂ², started from the [ESILV](https://www.esilv.fr/) school in Paris. The school put us in contact with [G. Marti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gautier-marti-344b565a/) who supplied the dataset.

This dataset is a .csv file containing daily closure prices for ~400 stocks tracked from early 2000 to late 2016. From the graph below we can see that 12% of data is missing. To be precise, 133 stocks have at least one missing entry, 90 have more than 30% missing entries and 62 have more than half missing entries. We discard those 90 stocks and end up with a dataset having only 1% missing data; moreover all stocks are time series of at least 10 years thus, when we will extrapolate the correlation/covariance matrices, for each single stock we will have a more heterogeneous history.

### Simple returns

After the above step we compute the simple returns by the formula

</p>

We present a brief summary of the first 8 columns of the cleaned dataset in the table below.
As can be noted by comparing the max values against the mean and the median we may suspect that there are outliers. However these are extreme values and are indeed part of the data distribution as can be seen in the histogram below.

We can indeed notice the presence of fat tails (notice that the y-axis is in log-scale).

In the next post we will see how the sample procedure and the noise smoothing were performed.
