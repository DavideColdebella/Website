I am finishing my Graduate degree in [Financial Engineering](https://apply.unipd.it/courses/course/23-mathematical-engineering--study-track-financial-engineering) between [Padua university](https://www.unipd.it/) and [ESILV](https://www.esilv.fr/).

This website was born from a collaboration with [G. Marti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gautier-marti-344b565a/), to whom I'm grateful for his support; however it does not represent his views.
